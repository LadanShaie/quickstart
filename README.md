Budget Therapy - Hackbright Project 
<p>Budget Therapy allows users to create budgets and monitor their status. Users are incentivised to meet their budget goals with the growth or decay of a symbolic virtual tree. If they go over budget, their tree dies. Otherwise, the user is rewarded with a tree that is planted in their growing garden. Budget Therapy is a full-stack web application, using javascript on the frontend with a Python Flask backend and a PostgreSQL database. <p>

<p> Project Tech Stack: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Flask, Jinja2,  jQuery, Bootstrap4, SQLAlchemy, & PostgreSQL.<p>
